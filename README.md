## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

My learning was focused on using an API and creating a responsive button element in Javascript.

## Optimizations

I'm a currently getting my sound play element working so that the app will have the able to say each word that is looked up.

## Lessons Learned:

As I am learning was building this application, I realized that not every project has to be complex in order to be succesful. I learned to appreciate simplicity while working on this app.
